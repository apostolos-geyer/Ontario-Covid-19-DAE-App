# Ontario Covid-19 DAE

This is a Java project me and my friend are working on a little bit for school, but mostly for fun (this is actually just extreme overkill for a Grade 12 Computer Science Project... we're nerds). The goal is to create an environment in Java build around [JTablesaw](https://github.com/jtablesaw/tablesaw) for accessing and visualizing the most recent Ontario COVID-19 data. Built around the library 

## Project Status 
Very early development and testing, however, we aim to have created a runnable visual environment with some cool features.
